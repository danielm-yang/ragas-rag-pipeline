Abel Makkonen Tesfaye (Amharic: አቤል መኮንን ተስፋዬ; born February 16, 1990), known professionally as the Weeknd, is a Canadian singer-songwriter.[2][3] He is known for his unconventional musical production, artistic reinventions and use of the falsetto register.  Tesfaye began releasing music anonymously in 2009. After co-founding the record label XO, he released three mixtapes—House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence—in 2011, and gained recognition for his blend of contemporary and alternative R&B, as well as the mystery surrounding his identity. He signed with Republic Records to reissue the mixtapes into the compilation album Trilogy (2012), and release his debut studio album, Kiss Land (2013) the following year. After a string of collaborations and film soundtrack contributions from 2013 and 2014, Tesfaye transitioned from alternative R&B to a pop sound with his second and third studio albums, Beauty Behind the Madness (2015) and Starboy (2016), both of which debuted atop the US Billboard 200. The former yielded his first two US Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles, "Can't Feel My Face" and "The Hills", while Starboy spawned two more: its title track (featuring Daft Punk), and after a 2023 remix with Ariana Grande, "Die for You".  He returned to alternative R&B for his debut extended play, My Dear Melancholy (2018), which included the US top-ten single "Call Out My Name". He explored the dream-pop and new wave genres with his fourth studio album, After Hours (2020), which spawned the record-setting single, "Blinding Lights", and two other US number-one singles: "Heartless" and "Save Your Tears". Tesfaye began exploring dance-pop, leading to his fifth album, Dawn FM (2022), which included the US top-ten single, "Take My Breath". In 2023, he co-created and starred in the HBO drama series The Idol, which was a critical failure, though its accompanying soundtrack saw commercial success.  Tesfaye has sold over 75 million records, making him one of the world's best-selling artists. He has earned seven diamond-certifications from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for his singles, and is the first artist to simultaneously hold the top three spots on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. "Blinding Lights" became the most-streamed song in Spotify history, the best-performing song in the Billboard Hot 100's history and the longest-charting song by a solo artist in the chart's history. Tesfaye was listed by Time as one of the world's most influential people in 2020, and was dubbed the "world's most popular artist" by Guinness World Records in 2023. An advocate for racial equality and food security, he was appointed a World Food Programme Goodwill Ambassador in 2021. His accolades include four Grammy Awards, 20 Billboard Music Awards, 22 Juno Awards, six American Music Awards, three MTV Video Music Awards, a Latin Grammy Award and nominations for an Academy Award and a Primetime Emmy Award.  Life and career Early life Abel Makkonen Tesfaye[a] was born on February 16, 1990, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.[4][5] The only child of Ethiopian Amhara immigrants Makkonen Tesfaye and Samrawit Hailu,[b] who separated shortly after his birth,[7][8] he was raised in the suburb of Scarborough by his mother and grandmother.[5][9] Tesfaye's patronymic is spelled "Makkonen" instead of the traditional Ethiopian name "Makonnen". The similarity with the Finnish surname Makkonen is pure coincidence. The spelling of Tesfaye's patronymic might be the result of a typographic error or a new form of the traditional name.[10] Tesfaye is proficient in Amharic, his native language acquired from his grandmother,[11] and is also fluent in French, as he attended a French immersion school.[12] He was further educated at West Hill Collegiate Institute and Birchmount Park Collegiate Institute.[13]  At seventeen, Tesfaye dropped out of school and relocated to an apartment in the neighbourhood of Parkdale with two friends, one of whom is La Mar Taylor—his best friend and now creative director.[14] Living a hedonistic lifestyle with his friends,[5][15] Tesfaye adopted his stage name because he left home on a weekend.[16] He removed the last 'e' in 'weekend' to avoid trademark issues with the Canadian pop rock band the Weekend.[17] He has also experienced homelessness and was incarcerated on several occasions during this time, which encouraged him to "smarten up, to focus".[18][19] During this time, Tesfaye frequently engaged in drug use, including substances such as ketamine, cocaine, MDMA, magic mushrooms, and cough syrup,[20] stating that drugs were a "crutch" for him when he wrote music.[21] Before releasing music under his current stage name, he went under the alias 'Kin Kane', as part of a hip-hop duo called 'Bulleez n Nerdz',[8] and was part of a production team called 'the Noise'.[22][23]  2009–2011: Career beginnings In August 2009, Tesfaye began anonymously releasing music on YouTube.[24][25] The following year, he met the producer Jeremy Rose at a party. Rose asked Tesfaye if he wanted to work together as a dark R&B project after hearing him freestyle over an instrumental. After creating multiple songs and parting ways due to creative differences, Tesfaye was allowed to use the songs they made together under the condition that Rose received production credits.[26] In December 2010, Tesfaye uploaded "What You Need", "Loft Music" and "The Morning" to YouTube under the username "xoxxxoooxo".[27][28] His identity remained undisclosed initially. These songs gained attention online and were later acknowledged in a blog post by the rapper Drake.[26][29] The songs subsequently received coverage from various media outlets, including Pitchfork and The New York Times.[30]  In 2011, Tesfaye met music executives Wassim "Sal" Slaiby and Amir "Cash" Esmailian, with whom, along with Taylor, he founded the XO record label.[31] On March 21, Tesfaye released his debut mixtape, House of Balloons,[c] which featured production from Illangelo and Doc McKinney. The mixtape also included tracks produced by Rose, although he did not receive production credits.[26] House of Balloons was named as one of the ten shortlisted nominees for the 2011 Polaris Music Prize.[35]  Tesfaye started working with Drake in May 2011, eventually earning a spot at the latter's OVO Fest on July 31.[36] In July 2011, Tesfaye held his first live performance at the Mod Club Theatre in Toronto.[37] He also participated in concerts hosted by the Black Student Association at the University of Toronto.[38] On August 18, Tesfaye released his second mixtape, Thursday, which garnered usually positive reviews.[39] Tesfaye contributed to four songs on Drake's second studio album, Take Care, released on November 15, as a songwriter, producer and a featured artist on the album's seventh single, "Crew Love".[40] He released his third mixtape, Echoes of Silence, on December 21. It was a longlisted nominee for the 2012 Polaris Music Prize.[41][42]  2012–2014: Trilogy and Kiss Land The Weeknd wearing a button-up, sleeveless shirt covering a normal black t-shirt.

The Hollywood Reporter stated that the series confirms the allegations that "Instead of subtly skewering the misogynistic and predatory nature of the business, The Idol became a forbidden love story — the stuff of a toxic man's fantasy", and called it "regressive rather than transgressive".[230] He received negative reviews for his acting, with critic Robert Daniels of The Playlist writing, "Tesfaye is also a terrible actor. He lacks the comfortability, the gravitas, charisma, and charm to increase the viability of Jocelyn being attracted to him. In most scenes, Tesfaye either hides under the cover of dim lighting, obtrusive coverage, or re-recorded dialogue dubbed into several scenes."[231] On August 28, 2023, HBO announced it had cancelled The Idol after one season.[232]  On June 8, 2023, the Weeknd announced series of EPs featuring music from The Idol. Originally intended as a soundtrack album, each EP was released following the premiere of each episode of the show, which featured collaborations with Future, Playboi Carti, Madonna, Lil Baby, Lily-Rose Depp, and Jennie from the South Korean girl group Blackpink.[233] Later in June he received an invitation from the Academy to become a member.[234]  On July 21, Tesfaye appeared on Travis Scott's lead single "K-pop" from his fourth studio album Utopia,[235] and later appeared on another track on Scott's album, "Circus Maximus". Tesfaye appeared on Diddy's single "Another One of Me" on September 15, which he called his "final feature",[236][237] despite releasing multiple collaborations with Metro Boomin and Future in 2024.  On December 2, 2023, Fortnite announced that the Weeknd would be featured as the headlining artist for its Fortnite Festival gamemode and outfits of him would become available to play with on December 9. His outfits have three different variants of himself; the red suit seen throughout the promotional material for After Hours, the outfit from his 2022 Coachella performance, and two of the costumes that he was seen wearing during the After Hours til Dawn Tour.[238]  2024: Hurry Up Tomorrow Tesfaye first teased news of a follow-up album to Dawn FM in 2022, telling his fans: "[I] wonder... did you know you're experiencing a new trilogy?" via Twitter.[239] On January 8, 2024, he further teased an upcoming album, posting pictures of his last two albums and a question mark on his social media.[240] On March 22, 2024, he appeared on the track "Young Metro" from Future and Metro Boomin's collaborative album, We Don't Trust You as well as several tracks on Future and Metro Boomin's We Still Don't Trust You album.[241]  On July 17, 2024, Tesfaye announced a one-night show in São Paulo, Brazil, set to take place on September 7, 2024.[242] He announced the title of his upcoming sixth album, Hurry Up Tomorrow, three days prior to the concert.[243][244]  Artistry Influences    Tesfaye cites Michael Jackson, Prince, and R. Kelly as his main musical inspirations. Tesfaye cites Michael Jackson, Prince, and R. Kelly as his main musical inspirations.[245] He has attributed Jackson's music as key in spurring him to be a singer, referencing the lyrics to "Dirty Diana" as an example.[8] His high-flying vocal style was influenced by Ethiopian singers such as Aster Aweke.[8] He grew up listening to a variety of music genres, including soul, hip hop, funk, indie rock, and post-punk.[246] Tesfaye is heavily influenced by 1980s music, and credits the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (2002) for "opening my eyes" to the music of that era.[247] "I've always had an admiration for the era before I was born", he said in an interview for Billboard. "You can hear it as far back as my first mixtape that the '80s – Siouxsie and the Banshees, Cocteau Twins – play such a huge role in my sound."[248]  Tesfaye has named Deftones as one of his influences during the making of House of Balloons, Thursday and Echoes of Silence.[249] He has also cited Lana Del Rey,[250] David Bowie,[251] the Smiths, Bad Brains, Talking Heads, DeBarge,[252] 50 Cent, Wu-Tang Clan,[253][254] and Eminem as influences and inspirations.[255][256] When Daft Punk announced their split in 2021, Tesfaye praised them during an interview with Variety, saying: "Those guys are one of the reasons I make music, so I can't even compare them to other people..."[257]  Production and songwriting Tesfaye's songs are "built around a fogged, crepuscular production",[258] and feature slow tempos,[259] rumbling bass, and forlorn echoes.[7] His music incorporates samples that are unconventional in R&B production, including punk, shoegaze, dream pop and alternative rock.[260] Marc Hogan of Spin says that Tesfaye's samples tend "to draw from rock critic-approved sources, though generally ones that already share elements of his sexual menace", sampling artists such as Beach House, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Aaliyah.[261] Tesfaye worked mostly with producers Illangelo and Doc McKinney, whom Ian Cohen of Pitchfork credits with developing "a state-of-the-art R&B template" with the artist.[259] In concert, Tesfaye reappropriates his digitized productions with a suite-like arena rock aesthetic.[7]  His emotional, plaintive lyrics often express feelings of hurt and deal with subject matter such as sex,[258] drugs, and partying; this is seen especially in After Hours and House of Balloons.[7] Hermione Hoby of The Guardian characterizes Tesfaye's songs as "narcotised-slow jams" and delineates their message as "partying is an existential experience, sex is fraught with alienation, and everything registers as unreal and unsettling."[258] Paul MacInnes of The Guardian stated that he views Tesfaye's three mixtapes as "a rough trajectory of party, after-party and hangover."[262] Anupa Mistry of the Toronto Standard observes throughout his mixtapes a "cast of supine, stoned zombie-women... whose legs willingly part after being plied with substances and who morph into threats only when [he is] coming down and feeling vulnerable."[7] Tesfaye has stated that by singing vulgar, ignorant lyrics in an elegant, sexy way, he is "paying homage to R Kelly, and even Prince to a certain extent."[263]  Voice and music style Tesfaye often sings in a falsetto register.[264] J. D. Considine finds his singing's "tremulous quality" similar to Michael Jackson, but writes that he eschews Jackson's "strong basis in the blues" for a more Arabic-influenced melisma.[260] Tesfaye possesses a wide light-lyric tenor vocal range, which spans over three octaves. His vocal range reaches its extreme low at the bass F (F2), and its peak high at the tenor G♯ (G♯5), with a natural tessitura within the upper fourth octave.[265][266] Tesfaye often makes use of his head voice to build resonance to belt out strong high notes within the fifth octave.[266] Tesfaye's vocals have a recognizable Ethiopian characteristic. Hannah Giogis of Pitchfork notes that "his trademark vibrato, the characteristically pained whine that pervades much of Tesfaye's music, draws from a long Ethiopian musical legacy of tortured pining. Imbuing our voices with the shaky pain of loss—romantic or otherwise—is a hallmark of Ethiopian musical tradition. Tesfaye, with his staccato wails and aching nostalgia, is a young, North American addition to a dynasty of melodramatic Ethiopian singers."[267] In 2023, Rolling Stone ranked the Weeknd at number 110 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[268]  Tesfaye's discography spans pop, R&B, hip hop, dance, alternative and new wave genres.[269] His work is generally categorized as alternative R&B, due to his contributions in broadening the genre's musical palette to incorporate indie and electronic styles.[270][271] Mistry writes that he "will be obsequiously praised as the future of R&B music—because Tesfaye is a black singer, not because he's making quantifiable, canonical R&B."[7] Tesfaye shared his thoughts on the primary label during an interview with Time in 2015, stating: "Alternative R&B is in my soul. It's not going anywhere. When I put out songs from House of Balloons in 2010, people said I made R&B cool again. I'm assuming that's when the label was created. I feel honored that a good part of today's music is inspired by it, consciously or subconsciously. The only way I could have done that was to be ambitious and grand."[272] Tesfaye's first three mixtapes; House of Balloons, Thursday and Echoes of Silence, are alternative R&B projects that draw on dream pop, post-punk and trip hop, amongst others.[273][274] His debut studio album Kiss Land is categorized as R&B and dark wave.[275] His next three albums, Beauty Behind the Madness, Starboy and After Hours, are considered R&B and pop; with Starboy utilizing heavy trap influences,[276][277] and After Hours drawing on new wave and dream pop influences.[278][279] Tesfaye's fifth studio album Dawn FM explores dance-pop and synth-pop genres.[280][281]  Controversies Plagiarism allegations In December 2015, Tesfaye was sued by Cutting Edge Music, which alleged that the bassline for "The Hills" had been taken from a composition featured in the score for the 2013 science fiction film The Machine.[282] One of the producers of the song was alleged to have sent a private Twitter message to Tom Raybould, the composer of the film's score, to tell him about the sample.[283] In September 2018, Tesfaye and Daft Punk were sued for allegedly stealing the rhythm for "Starboy" from Ethiopian poet and singer-songwriter Yasminah.[284] Tesfaye denied the allegations.[285]  In April 2019, Tesfaye was sued by British trio William Smith, Brian Clover, and Scott McCulloch, who accused Tesfaye of copyright infringement from plagiarising their song "I Need to Love" in order to create his song "A Lonely Night". They sought $150,000 from Tesfaye and Belly. In August 2019, the lawsuit was dismissed via summary judgment with the option to amend, with the court ruling that they had failed to show that Tesfaye or anyone else involved in making "A Lonely Night" had access to their song or that the works were substantially similar.[286] In September 2019, the plaintiffs filed an amended claim based on secondary infringement, which is still in litigation.[287][288]  In February 2020, Tesfaye and Kendrick Lamar were sued by the now-defunct indie band Yeasayer, claiming that "Pray for Me" includes an unauthorized sample of their song "Sunrise".[289] Later that year, Yeasayer voluntarily dismissed their lawsuit.[290] In September 2021, Tesfaye, Nicolás Jaar, and Frank Dukes were sued for copyright infringement by producers Suniel Fox and Henry Strange, protesting that "Call Out My Name" is "strikingly [or] substantially similar, if not identical" to their 2015 track "Vibeking".[291][292]  Allegations of homophobic lyrics In January 2019, Tesfaye was criticized for some of the lyrics in his and Gesaffelstein's single "Lost in the Fire". The second verse of the song, with the lines "You said you might be into girls, said you're going through a phase / Keeping your heart safe / Well, baby, you can bring a friend / She can ride on top your face / While I fuck you straight", were accused of being homophobic, fetishizing bisexuality, and perpetuating the falsehood that a person who identifies as being part of the LGBTQ+ community can be "turned straight".[293][294] Tesfaye subtly addressed the controversy in the song "Snowchild" from After Hours, with the lines "Every month another accusation / Only thing I'm phobic of is failing".[295][296]  The Idol allegations On March 1, 2023, Rolling Stone released a lengthy exposé on the working conditions and set life of the HBO drama series The Idol, a series in which Tesfaye stars, co-created and co-wrote alongside Sam Levinson. The series received significant controversy for its graphic depiction of sexual content which critics labeled "torture porn". The series was originally directed by Amy Seimetz who suddenly "exited with roughly 80 percent of the six-episode series finished". The series saw a major creative overhaul, as it was reported that Tesfaye felt the show had too much of a "female perspective". Over 14 crew members alleged a toxic work environment with one adding "What I signed up for was a dark satire of fame and the fame model in the 21st century..." however, "It went from satire to the thing it was satirizing." Sources alleged that Seimetz's approach to the story was scrapped and the show became "like any rape fantasy that any toxic man would have in the show — and then the woman comes back for more because it makes her music better".[297]  In response to the allegations, Tesfaye mocked the reporting on his Twitter account, posting a clip of the characters in the show discussing the magazine saying, "Rolling Stone? Aren't they a little irrelevant?". Tesfaye posted the comment in the caption: "@Rolling Stone did we upset you?".[298][299] Tesfaye's response received widespread criticism.[300] In an interview with Vanity Fair, he continued to dismiss the reporting, saying that logistical difficulties with Seimetz's schedule and production timelines, as well as a desire not to rush his first show, propelled the overhaul.[301]  Other ventures Acting Tesfaye is a cinephile, and has made numerous movie references in his music videos and teasers.[302][303] On August 30, 2019, during the Telluride Film Festival, he made his acting debut in the film Uncut Gems.[304]  On March 7, 2020, during his third appearance as a musical guest on Saturday Night Live, he starred in the skit "On The Couch" with actors Kenan Thompson and Chris Redd.[305] On May 4, he co-wrote and starred in an episode of American Dad!.[306] In July, he voiced three characters during the 200th episode of Robot Chicken.[307]  On June 29, 2021, Tesfaye announced that he would be co-creating, co-writing, executive producing and starring in the HBO television drama series The Idol, alongside his producing partner Reza Fahim and Euphoria creator Sam Levinson.[308] On March 20, 2022, Tesfaye voiced two characters during an episode of The Simpsons.[309]  In 2023, it was announced that Tesfaye is co-writing a film with Trey Edward Shults, who is attached to direct; Tesfaye is also set to star in the film, alongside Jenna Ortega and Barry Keoghan.[310][311]  Business In 2013, Tesfaye collaborated with condom company ONE to give away limited-edition condoms at his shows during the Kiss Land Fall Tour.[312][313] In November 2015, he partnered with electronic vaporizer company Pax Labs to release a limited edition vaporizer.[314][315] He also collaborated with fashion designer Alexander Wang for an apparel collection.[316] In 2016, Tesfaye became a creative collaborator and global brand ambassador for the clothing brand Puma.[317] With the partnership, he released numerous capsule collections and hosted several pop-up retail stores.[318][319]  In 2017, Tesfaye partnered with retail company H&M for their men's collection.[320] He cut ties with the company in 2018, following a racist incident within the company.[321] In July 2018, Tesfaye collaborated with Marvel Comics to release a comic book inspired by his third studio album Starboy.[322] In August, he released an apparel collection in collaboration with A Bathing Ape.[323][324] A second collection was released in January 2020.[325]  In April 2019, Tesfaye became an owner and global ambassador of the esports company OverActive Media, who owns the Splyce and Overwatch League team Toronto Defiant.[326]  On August 31, 2020, Tesfaye partnered with TD Bank to launch Black HXOUSE, an entrepreneurial initiative within the incubator HXOUSE, where he serves as a sleeping partner.[327] On September 9, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a CA$221,000,000 joint venture with HXOUSE for Black Canadian entrepreneurs.[328]  In March 2021, Tesfaye auctioned a collection of visual artwork and an unreleased song in the form of a non-fungible token (NFT) on Nifty Gateway.[329][330] In October, he joined football player Tom Brady's NFT platform Autograph as a member of their board of directors.[331]  In 2022, Tesfaye invested in plant-based beverage brand Koia.[332]  Philanthropy After being presented with a Bikila Award for Professional Excellence in 2014, Tesfaye donated CA$50,000 to the University of Toronto to fund a new course on Ge'ez, the classic language of Ethiopia.[333] In May 2016, during Orthodox Easter, Tesfaye donated CA$50,000 to the St. Mary Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Cathedral in Toronto, Canada, a church he attended growing up.[334][335] In August 2016, he funded a new Ethiopian studies program at the University of Toronto.[336]  In June 2017, Tesfaye donated US$100,000 to the Suubi Health Center, a maternity and children's medical facility in Budondo, Uganda.
